# Array

Arrays are a type of data storage that you often use in C programs.

# Structure

Combine variables into a single package called a structure.
```bash
struct sampleName
{
    int a;
    char b;
}

```

*	This structure is named sampleName.
*	It contains two variables: an integer named a and a character named b.
*	The above command only creates the structure.(it doesn't declare any variables.)

The following line declares a structure variable named s1.
```bash
struct sample s1;
```

Items within the structure are referred to by using dot notation.

```bash
printf("Character 1 is %s\n",g1.name);
```
